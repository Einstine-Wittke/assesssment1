    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol class="order">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how elements are to be displayed on screen , paper , or in other media. </li>
        <li> <s>Css is not necessary</s>  <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages
            all at once. </li>
        <li class="container">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="unorder">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <mark>in this
                tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this is easy to demonstrate, and easier
            for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on
            the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
            link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element
            has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
            target elements to which a style should be applied.
